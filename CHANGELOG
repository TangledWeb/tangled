0.1a6 (unreleased)
==================

- No changes yet


0.1a5 (2014-02-09)
==================

- Allow .py files in scaffolds to have a .template suffix. This is necessary
  for .py files that use `${var}`s that aren't inside strings. Otherwise, those
  files will cause a `SyntaxError` when the package containing the scaffold is
  installed.


0.1a4 (2014-02-06)
==================

- Add `tangled python` command
- Add -y flag to `tangled release` command (assume answer to all prompts is
  yes)
- Don't offer to push tags in `tangled release`; pushing stuff is outside the
  scope of this tool.
