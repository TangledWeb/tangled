class cached_property:

    """Similar to @property but caches value on first access.

    When a cached property is first accessed, its value will be computed
    and cached in the instance's ``__dict__``. Subsequent accesses will
    retrieve the cached value from the instance's ``__dict__``.

    The property can be set and deleted as usual. When the property is
    deleted, its value will be recomputed and reset on the next access.

    It's safe to ``del`` a property that hasn't been set--this won't
    raise an attribute error as might be expected since a cached
    property can't really be deleted (since it will be recomputed the
    next time it's accessed).

    A cached property can specify its dependencies (other cached
    properties) so that when its dependencies are set or deleted, the
    cached property will be cleared and recomputed on next access::

        >>> class T:
        ...
        ...     @cached_property
        ...     def a(self):
        ...         return 'a'
        ...
        ...     @cached_property('a')
        ...     def b(self):
        ...         return '%s + b' % self.a
        ...
        ...
        >>> t = T()
        >>> t.a
        'a'
        >>> t.b
        'a + b'
        >>> t.a = 'A'
        >>> t.b
        'A + b'

    When a property has been set directly (as opposed to via access), it
    won't be reset when its dependencies are set or deleted. If the
    property is later cleared, it will then be recomputed::

        >>> t = T()
        >>> t.b = 'B'  # set t.b directly
        >>> t.b
        'B'
        >>> t.a = 'A'
        >>> t.b  # t.b was set directly, so setting t.a doesn't affect it
        'B'
        >>> del t.b
        >>> t.b  # t.b was cleared, so it's computed from t.a
        'A + b'
